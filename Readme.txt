Mongo Trade - personal financial quote engine

Uses MongoDB as data store.

Imports quotes from the usual suspects Yahoo, Netfonds and Google.
Google data is usually missing volume, not recommend!

Does it work?

Yes! But only through a very poorly written console app. Symbols must be added manually.
